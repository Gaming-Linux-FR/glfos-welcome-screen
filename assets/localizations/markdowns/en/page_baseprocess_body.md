After logging into your session, you'll notice that **GNOME is pre-configured**.

We offer extensions such as:

- **GSConnect** to connect your smartphone,
- **Caffeine** to disable the screensaver and automatic suspend  
  (useful for avoiding sleep mode during gaming sessions).

The **Dash-to-Dock** extension is also included ‚Äî the main game launchers are already pinned!

On the applications side, we provide basic apps to cover your **office-related needs**.

üñ®Ô∏è Printers are supported ‚Äî you just need to add them to GNOME!
